It provides nine steps for prize administrators to consider when developing their own prize competition, as well as exemplar practices and considerations to take into account. The competition involved a variety of tasks such as submitting entries, evaluating entries, and awarding prizes. The paper also acknowledges the contributions of the L2M Prize Planning Group, L2M Steering Committee, and L2M Subcommittee Co-Chairs.'"
